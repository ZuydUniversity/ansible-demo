### Coding guideline
- Add all variables into `vars`. In tasks, use variables then. Goal is user just need to update `vars` part, then no need to change tasks itself.
- File naming convention: ServiceName_Action_Properties.yml
- Folder layout: if there're multiple sample playbooks for one service, eg. subnet, you could create a folder to hold all samples.
